However, while MilesWeb has a lot to offer, there are some issues to consider, including vague terms in its refund and uptime guarantee policies. Despite these concerns, it remains a popular choice, particularly for Indian users or those targeting a local audience.

- **Shobhit from India**: "Their money-back guarantee is fake. They demand extra charges that weren't mentioned in the invoice. Not satisfied with the refund process."
